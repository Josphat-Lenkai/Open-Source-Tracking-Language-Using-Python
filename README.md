# Open-Source-Tracking-Language-Using-Python

Welcome to the Open Source Language Tracking System! This project is designed to track and analyze open-source programming languages (Python) for syntax errors. Contributors and users can submit code snippets, and the system will analyze them, providing feedback on potential errors.

## Introduction

The Open Source Language Tracking System is a tool developed for analyzing and tracking Python code snippets. It leverages the Python AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) module to identify syntax errors in the submitted code.

## Features

- Syntax error analysis using Python AST.
- Web interface for users to submit code snippets.
- Feedback on potential errors in the submitted code.
